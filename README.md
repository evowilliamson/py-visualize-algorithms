# Visualization of algorithms in Python

This repository aims to make good visualizations of algorithms which are used in computer science.

Just setting up everything.. more to come. 

For now, please checkout the issues or go through the code and come up with some ideas.

Getting started:

1. Install Python (3.5 at least)
2. Install pip
3. Install Visual Code*
4. Install the Python Extension for VC
5. Start Visual Code
6. Copy the contents of example.vscode.settings.json to your user default settings
7. Install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
8. Test cases should be discovered automatically by VS Code. You might need to restart though
9. Run the test cases

* Of course another IDE can be used :-)
